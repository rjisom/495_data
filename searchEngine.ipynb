# CST 495 Data Science For Search, Spring 2016
# @uthors: Richard Isom, Joshua Kim
#
#  This program was designed to look into tf-idf and bm25 techniques for making a search engine
# to test and explore the functionality and user feedback on queries given by volunteer testers
# Medical text obtained from http://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/statnlpgroup/nfcorpus/
# Search engine template designed after https://github.com/mattwg/data-science-for-search
