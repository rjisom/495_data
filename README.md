# 495_data
Class assignment for CST 495 - Data Science for Search CSUMB Spring 2016

This first program was part of a course assignment that introduced students to spark, map reduce, and machine learning. The first part of the course was to produce a search engine utilizing information retrieval techniques such as tf-idf (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) and ranking functions such as Okapi BM25 applied text articles we retrieved online. The program was tested among a few individuals to gain feedback. We also looked into the possibility of pairing our program with a distributed hadoop cluster for map reduce for the possibility of larger data sets. 

The second part of the program had us looking into advancing our search engine to use machine learning techniques to help present better matches. We looked into utilizing tagging algorithms along with clustering, support vectors, and regression.
